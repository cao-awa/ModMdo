## build
here is ``` main ``` fork\
usually, we recommend your build on other fork\
do not build jar in this fork

but if you wanna, also can build in here\
current ``` main ``` is build as 1.17.1

if you know how to modify version\
then you can build as other version on ``` main ```

but if you are not build as 1.17.1\
maybe cause some bug to cause you cannot launch game\
or crash the game, that need fix by you self
